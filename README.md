## About

`model-mixin` creates objects that can be used to mix a set of instance and static methods into a [Mongoose](http://mongoosejs.com) model, [Backbone](http://backbonejs.org) model, plain JavaScript object and classes/models from other frameworks.

It's purpose is to enable a high degree of code reuse when building full stack JavaScript applications with domain model representations on both client and server.

## Background

At [Good Eggs](http://www.goodeggs.com) we are on a quest for a ubiquitous domain model implementation that works across frameworks in both the browser and in Node.js.
When you have an instance of a domain model in our applications, we want it to have the same interface and behavior, regardless
of where it is running. We don't want it to be tied to some favorite framework of the day.

In this quest we've been using a strategy in our apps at Good Eggs that achieves a similar end with a different strategy.
We write mixins that add behavior to models from different frameworks. So if you have reference to a User model in
Mongoose or Backbone or as a JavaScript object from a JSON API, it has the same interface backed by the same code. It's not the final answer but yields a ton
of immediate benefit in minimizing code duplication and sharing behavior across browser and server.

## Usage

### Write a mixin

```
var modelMixin = require('model-mixin');

var UserMixin = modelMixin({
  methods: {
    uppercaseName: function() {
      return this.get('name').toUpperCase();
    }
   },

  statics: {
    version: function() {
      return '1.0.0';
    }
  }
});

module.exports = UserMixin;
```

### Mix in to Backbone model

```
var User = Backbone.Model.extend({});
UserMixin(User);

var user = new User({name: 'Noah'});
console.log user.uppercaseName(); // NOAH
console.log(User.version()); // 1.0.0
```

### Mix in to Mongoose model

```
var mongoose = require('mongoose');
var UserMixin = require('./user_mixin');

var schema = new mongoose.Schema({
  name: String
});
UserMixin(schema);
var User = mongoose.model('User', schema);

var user = new User({name: 'Noah'});
console.log(user.uppercaseName()); // NOAH
console.log(User.version()); // 1.0.0
```

### Mix in to JavaScript object
```
var UserMixin = require('./user_mixin');

var user = {name: 'Noah'};
UserMixin(user);

console.log(user.uppercaseName()); // NOAH
```

At Good Eggs we often use this last scenario when loading objects in bulk via Mongoose `lean` but still want to use our business logic on the loaded data. How do mixins that access attributes via a `get` method work with plain objects? We use [getto](https://github.com/goodeggs/getto)!
